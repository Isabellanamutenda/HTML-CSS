    <h3>How Frog came to be King of Rivers and Marshes</h3>
    <h4>There was a time when animals and people lived on the earth harmoniously side by side. Each respected the other, and they went out of their way to be friendly and useful to each other.

The elephant being the King of the animals decided one day that there should be a King of the Rivers and Marshes. He thought it would be useful to have somebody responsible for alerting people to the coming of the first rains, so that they would have time to get ready and start preparing their tools and seeds.

The king of the animals sent out his trusted town cryer, the cockerel, with a message that any animal who wished to be considered should attend the King’s court the following morning. The cockerel dutifully made his way all round the animal village, passing the King’s messages to all and sundry. The next morning the elephant came into his court yard after having partaken of his breakfast, and found a number of candidates for the post had gathered there. The cat was there, and the monkey. Toad and frog stood side by side, flamingo was there and the crab had also turned up.
