   <p>I have one brother and one sister. I look up to my mother she is a hardworking woman and also my role model. My greatest fear is dissapointing those people who love me and have so much hope in me and also dissapointing myself. My other fear is failing i just hate failing with passion. </p>

    <p><em><b>I want to be a software developer because if my passion in computer and technology</b></em>. I want to prove the men in technology that they are only ones who can be in technology but we as women we can do what they can do. I want to be proud of myself that if someone asks me that did you this and I say yes I dit it myself not saying that i was helped by a man. </p>
    <p>My hobbies, I love swimming, badminton, I also love adventures and travelling. I also learnt that when you are mad or sad just do what you love and what makes you happy you will be back to normal.
